[![Gobuild Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/gobuild-download-green.svg?style=flat)](http://gobuild.io/github.com/novaquark/sysinfo_influxdb) [![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/novaquark/sysinfo_influxdb.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/novaquark/sysinfo_influxdb)

A collecting tool of system metrics (CPU, memory, load, disks I/Os, network traffic) to an [InfluxDB](http://influxdb.org) server.

## Usage sample

To display all metrics without sending them to a server :

    $GOPATH/bin/sysinfo_influxdb

To send metric to an InfluxDB server, only one time :

    $GOPATH/bin/sysinfo_influxdb -h localhost:8086 -u root -p secret -d database

Password can also be read from a file if you don't want to specify it in CLI (`-p` is ignored if specified with `-s`) :

    $GOPATH/bin/sysinfo_influxdb -h localhost:8086 -u root -s /etc/sysinfo.secret -d database

You can ommit `-h`, `-u`, `-p` or `-s` if you use default settings.

By default, table are prefixed by the hostname, to change or disable the prefix, just do :

    $GOPATH/bin/sysinfo_influxdb -P "" # Disable prefix
    $GOPATH/bin/sysinfo_influxdb -P "koala"

To append FQDN of the running host at the end of injected data, use the `--fqdn` flag :

    $GOPATH/bin/sysinfo_influxdb --fqdn

To run in daemon mode (doesn't fork, just loop), use the `-D` option :

    $GOPATH/bin/sysinfo_influxdb -D

To display data even if you send them to a server, use `-v` :

    $GOPATH/bin/sysinfo_influxdb -D -h localhost:8086 -d database -v

Use the `-i` option to change the collect interval; this option preserves the consistency of quantities displayed or sent (CPUs, network or disks I/Os) : so you can store in the same table the amount of outgoing packets in 1 minute to the same amount outgoing in 1 second (use `-C` option to alter the consistency factor). For example, to collect statistics each minute :

    $GOPATH/bin/sysinfo_influxdb -i 1m

To change data collected, use the `-c` option with one or more metrics type (`cpu`, `cpus`, `mem`, `swap`, `uptime`, `load`, `network`, `disks`, `mounts`) like this :

    $GOPATH/bin/sysinfo_influxdb -c cpus # Collect only CPUs related statistics by CPU core
    $GOPATH/bin/sysinfo_influxdb -c load,cpu,disks # Collect load average, global CPU and disks I/Os statistics
    $GOPATH/bin/sysinfo_influxdb -c mem,mounts # Collect memory metrics and local filesystems usage

On Linux hardened kernel, you must be allowed to read `/proc/net/dev` in order to collect networking statistics.
